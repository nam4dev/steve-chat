The code works, but it is not very clean to me.

  - You should organize it well. Separate the differents layers.
  - You need to add a script to initialize your database (MySQL or SQLite3).
  - You need to follow the tutorial link I put in the code to configure MySQL if you need to (https://hevodata.com/learn/flask-mysql/)
  - You need to update the SQLite3 database path as it uses my file system to make it work.

Good luck!
